Hi, I'm (William) Derek Jones.


I graduated from the University of Kentucky in May of 2018 where I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a research focus in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and its applications to Computational Biology and Drug Discovery. I was advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://www.cs.uky.edu/~jacobs) (Computer Science) and [Dr. Sally R. Ellingson](http://www.sallyrellingson.com/) (Biomedical Informatics).


I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at [University of California - San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) in the [Systems Energy Efficiency (SEE) Lab](http://varys.ucsd.edu/) where I am advised by Dr. Tajana S. Rosing and [Dr. Niema Moshiri](https://niema.net/) and mentored by [Dr. Jonathan E. Allen](https://people.llnl.gov/allen99) of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://www.llnl.gov/). I am a UC LFRP 2023 In-Residence National Laboratory Graduate Fellow, a partnership of the UC Office of the President's Research and Innovation and Office of National Laboratories. My PhD work is focused on finding ways in which we can enable the acceleration of molecular simulations by augmenting traditional physics-based modeling with ideas from machine learning and hardware acceleration. I work on scalable machine learning/deep learning research for drug discovery at LLNL and the [ATOM Constortium](https://atomscience.org).

I graduated from the University of Kentucky in May of 2018 where I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a research focus in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and its applications to Computational Biology and Drug Discovery with the help of High Performance Computing resources. I was advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://www.cs.uky.edu/~jacobs) (Computer Science) and [Dr. Sally R. Ellingson](http://www.sallyrellingson.com/) (Biomedical Informatics).

In my free time I enjoy running and hiking, watching basketball, a little golf, and music! Feel free to contact me with collaborations, I'm always interested in learning more about the world.
