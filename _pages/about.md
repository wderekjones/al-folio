Hi, I'm (William) Derek Jones.

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) in the [Systems Energy Efficiency (SEE) Lab](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/) where I am advised by [Dr. Tajana S. Rosing](http://seelab.ucsd.edu/) and [Dr. Niema Moshiri](https://niema.net/) and mentored by [Dr. Jonathan E. Allen](https://people.llnl.gov/allen99) of [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)](https://www.llnl.gov/). My research is focused on molecular representation learning using physics-informed learning algorithms and high performance computing (HPC). I am thankful to have been awarded a UC National Laboratory FEES Research fellowship to support my PhD work.

I graduated from the University of Kentucky in May of 2018 where I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science with a research focus in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and its applications to Computational Biology and Drug Discovery with the help of HPC. I was advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](https://jacobsn.github.io/) (Computer Science) and [Dr. Sally R. Ellingson](https://medicine.uky.edu/users/sel228) (Biomedical Informatics).
