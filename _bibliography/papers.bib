  abstract = "Protein-ligand interactions are essential to drug discovery and
              drug development efforts. Desirable on-target or multitarget
              interactions are the first step in finding an effective
              therapeutic, while undesirable off-target interactions are the
              first step in assessing safety. In this work, we introduce a novel
              ligand-based featurization and mapping of human protein pockets to
              identify closely related protein targets and to project novel
              drugs into a hybrid protein-ligand feature space to identify their
              likely protein interactions. Using structure-based template
              matches from PDB, protein pockets are featured by the ligands that
              bind to their best co-complex template matches. The simplicity and
              interpretability of this approach provide a granular
              characterization of the human proteome at the protein-pocket level
              instead of the traditional protein-level characterization by
              family, function, or pathway. We demonstrate the power of this
              featurization method by clustering a subset of the human proteome
              and evaluating the predicted cluster associations of over 7000
              compounds.",
